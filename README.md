Hong Kong is known as the most expensive real estate market in the World. According to the Urban Reform Institute and Frontier Centre for Public Policy, Hong Kong has remained the world's least affordable housing marker for over 11 years.

Despite the recent economic and political instabillity, Hong Kong property values are continuously increasing, with the demand for luxury mansions, shoebox apartments, and everything in between is at all-times highs.

In this project, I analyze the real estate property transactions dataset made available by a Kaggle user, who scraped a local real estate property website to collect the transaction data for years 2003-2019. Upon cleaning the data and selecting a subset of the data including records of transactions occured in 2019 (most recent year available in the dataset), I create data visualizations to summarize the Hong Kong property values by district.
